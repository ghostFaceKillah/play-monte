Playing Montezuma's Revenge for greater good
============================================

Good luck !

Steering: arrows + space for jump

Recording stops if you don't move for 5 seconds.

Dependencies
============

cv2, gym, pygame

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install gym[atari]
pip install pygame
```


Running
------
```
python gather_data.py

```
or if you prefer fullscreen
```
python gather_fullscreen.py

```


Idea
----
Pressing down cancels other arrows, etc.
